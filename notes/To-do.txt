1. Add comments to QuickSort.cpp 
2. Fix findPivot function 
3. SortTester.cpp needs fixing/updates
-> a: rename runTests()/reportResults() to runManualTests() and reportManualTestResults() 
-> b: runManualTests() should call runManualTest() -> just create a separate function, it's doing too much right now.
-> c: SortTester can use counting sort as a baseline -> generate random test cases and test against this
-> d: Call these functions runTests()/runTest()/reportTestResults() as they are automatic tests 
-> e: create a simple timer function, then save the results based on n 
4. Visualise results for the three implemented sorts in Python 
5. Create a GitHub pages webpage depicting the results so far 
6. Finish implementation of remaining sorts
